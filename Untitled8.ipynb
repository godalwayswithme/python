        "1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum. He started working on Python in the late 1980s and released its first version, Python 0.9.0, in February 1991. Van Rossum designed Python to be easy to read, with a clean syntax and powerful features, drawing inspiration from languages like ABC, C, and Modula-3. Python's philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it widely popular for beginners and experienced programmers alike.\n",

        "2. Which type of Programming does Python support?\n",
        "Python supports multiple programming paradigms, making it a versatile language. The key programming paradigms supported by Python include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python allows the use of objects and classes to structure code in a modular and reusable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Procedural Programming: Python supports procedural programming, which organizes code into procedures or routines (functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "Functional Programming: Python has first-class functions and supports functional programming concepts, like higher-order functions, anonymous functions (lambda), map, filter, and reduce.\n",
        "\n",
        "Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): Python can support AOP to modularize cross-cutting concerns, though it's less commonly used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scripting: Python can be used for scripting, automating tasks and writing small utility programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic Programming: Python supports dynamic typing and dynamic memory management.\n",
        "\n",
        "These diverse paradigms make Python highly flexible for various applications, including web development, data science, automation, and more.\n",

        "4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
        "Yes, Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers. This means that variable names, function names, and other identifiers must be used with consistent capitalization. For example, MyVariable, myvariable, and MYVARIABLE would be treated as three different identifiers in Python.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Python is primarily an interpreted language. When you run Python code, it is first compiled into an intermediate bytecode, which is then interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). This process allows for dynamic execution and debugging, but Python is not typically considered a compiled language like C or Java.\n",
